The Moral Debater: A Study on the Computational Generation of Morally Framed Arguments

00:00:05.767 --> 00:00:12.572
An audience's prior beliefs and morals are strong indicators of how likely they will be affected by a given argument.

00:00:12.572 --> 00:00:18.527
Utilizing such knowledge can help focus on shared values to bring disagreeing parties towards agreement.

00:00:18.527 --> 00:00:23.419
In argumentation technology, however, this is barely exploited so far.

00:00:23.419 --> 00:00:30.774
This paper studies the feasibility of automatically generating morally framed arguments as well as their effect on different audiences.

00:00:30.774 --> 00:00:37.879
Following the moral foundation theory, we propose a system that effectively generates arguments focusing on different morals.

00:00:37.879 --> 00:00:44.322
In an in-depth user study, we ask liberals and conservatives to evaluate the impact of these arguments.

00:00:44.322 --> 00:00:52.389
Our results suggest that, particularly when prior beliefs are challenged, an audience becomes more affected by morally framed arguments.

00:00:52.389 --> 00:00:54.044
Introduction

00:00:54.044 --> 00:00:59.774
In the last years, more research has been dedicated to studying prior beliefs in argumentation.

00:00:59.774 --> 00:01:06.229
Understanding the role of prior beliefs helps people craft more effective arguments when targeting a particular audience.

00:01:06.229 --> 00:01:26.847
Accordingly, operationalizing knowledge about the audience as part of supporting tools for humans or realized in fully automated debating technologies (Slonim et al., 2021) could benefit the production of arguments that bridge the gap between disputed parties by focusing on the shared beliefs rather than divisive ones (Alshomary and Wachsmuth, 2021).

00:01:26.847 --> 00:01:38.327
In social psychology, a body of research employs the notion of morals to understand people's judgments on controversial topics (Haidt, 2012;Fulgoni et al., 2016).

00:01:38.327 --> 00:01:45.832
Feinberg and Willer (2015) demonstrated that arguments become more effective when they match the morals of the target audience.

00:01:45.832 --> 00:02:00.812
Multiple works in computational linguistics have analyzed the persuasive effectiveness of arguments depending on the target audience (Durmus and Cardie, 2018;El Baff et al., 2020), showing that audience-based features reliably predict effectiveness.

00:02:00.812 --> 00:02:11.167
Different proxies of beliefs have been proposed as part of this, ranging from interests and personality traits  to stances on popular issues (Alshomary et al., 2021a).

00:02:11.167 --> 00:02:16.322
The authors of the latter used the stances to control the generation of argumentative texts.

00:02:16.322 --> 00:02:24.239
However, they did not assess the effectiveness of these texts on the audience, leaving the importance of encoding beliefs ultimately unclear.

00:02:24.239 --> 00:02:33.132
Beyond that, little research has been done on generating arguments tailored towards a specific audience, let alone on the importance of morals in achieving agreement.

00:02:33.132 --> 00:02:40.962
This work studies the feasibility of generating morally framed arguments computationally and the effect of these arguments on different audiences.

00:02:40.962 --> 00:02:52.454
For this, we rely on the moral foundation theory (Haidt, 2012) that projects the moral system into five foundations: care, fairness, loyalty, authority, and purity.

00:02:52.454 --> 00:02:58.684
To produce arguments that address specific morals, we extend the capabilities of Project Debater (Slonim e

00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.180
t al., 2021).

00:00:02.180 --> 00:00:10.385
1 Project Debater includes a hybrid approach of multiple components designed to generate arguments of high quality that compete with human arguments.

00:00:10.385 --> 00:00:19.552
Building on this technology helps us focus on evaluating the impact of morally framed arguments, as it ensures a certain base quality level in the generation.

00:00:19.552 --> 00:00:26.632
In particular, our proposed extended system takes as input a controversial topic, a stance, and a set of morals.

00:00:26.632 --> 00:00:36.937
It retrieves a set of argumentative texts, filters the ones conveying the input morals, and finally phrases an argument holding the given stance on the given topic focusing on the given morals.

00:00:36.937 --> 00:00:43.767
To identify morals in texts, we rely on distant supervision: We use the Reddit dataset of Schiller et al.

00:00:43.767 --> 00:00:51.810
2020), which contains argumentative texts with annotated aspects, along with the moral-to-concept lexicon of Hulpus et al.

00:00:51.810 --> 00:00:55.915
2020) for the automatic mapping from aspects to morals.

00:00:55.915 --> 00:01:02.082
Then, we train a BERT-based classifier, achieving high performance on the moral dataset of Kobbe et al.

00:01:02.082 --> 00:01:05.475
2020) compared to ablation baselines.

00:01:05.475 --> 00:01:13.367
To assess the effect of morally framed arguments on a particular audience, we consider liberals and conservatives as alternative audiences.

00:01:13.367 --> 00:01:18.735
We study the question of whether morally loaded arguments are more effective on a specific audience.

00:01:18.735 --> 00:01:27.315
Additionally, we investigate whether differently-framed moral arguments (targeting different morals) vary in their effect on liberals and conservatives.

00:01:27.315 --> 00:01:29.607
In line with El Baff et al.

00:01:29.607 --> 00:01:33.900
2018), we design a user study to answer both questions.

00:01:33.900 --> 00:01:45.005
Our study separately asks three liberals and three conservatives to rank different arguments on specific controversial issues based on how effective they were in challenging or empowering the audience's stance.

00:01:45.005 --> 00:01:53.810
The results suggest that, when arguments challenge the stance, the morally framed ones are generally more effective, especially for the conservative audience.

00:01:53.810 --> 00:02:01.952
We find that liberals value arguments that focus on their own morals (care and fairness) the most, especially when their stance is challenged.

00:02:01.952 --> 00:02:13.245
Although conservatives also value respective arguments, a focus on typically conservative morals (loyalty, authority, and purity) becomes more relevant to them when their stance is challenged.

00:02:13.245 --> 00:02:20.887
Despite the limited size of our user study, these findings hint at the importance of utilizing morals to craft more effective arguments.

00:02:20.887 --> 00:02:25.305
The code, the trained model, and the data are made publicly available.

00:02:25.305 --> 00:02:33.922

Prior Beliefs in Argumentation Studying persuasiveness in argumentation is an active field of research.

00:02:54.779 --> 00:03:01.456
Besides planning argument content, 2 https://github.com/webis-

00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:10.455
de/ACL-22 structure, and style (Wachsmuth et al., 2018), researchers also considered audience-based features to model persuasiveness.

00:00:10.455 --> 00:00:16.247
Among these, both Durmus and Cardie (2018) (Haidt and Joseph, 2004).

00:00:16.247 --> 00:00:39.577
According to the theory, humans subconsciously adhere to five basic moral foundations when judging controversial issues: fairness (importance of justice, rights, and equality), care (being kind, and avoiding harm), loyalty (self-sacrifice, solidarity, belongingness), authority (respect to traditions and hierarchy), and purity (sacredness of religion and human).

00:00:39.577 --> 00:00:46.745
Based on this theory, the disagreement between liberals and conservatives can be explained by the moral gap between the two parties.

00:00:46.745 --> 00:01:05.075
While liberals rely mainly on care and fairness (so-called individualizing morals) in their assessment of controversial issues, conservatives consider all moral foundations more evenly, somewhat skewed towards the binding morals though, that is, loyalty, authority, and purity (Graham et al., 2009).

00:01:05.075 --> 00:01:19.555
Several studies provided evidence of the robustness of the moral foundation theory in understanding people's behaviors and decisions (Feinberg and Willer, 2015;Fulgoni et al., 2016;Johnson and Goldwasser, 2018).

00:01:19.555 --> 00:01:22.710
For computational purposes, Kobbe et al.

00:01:22.710 --> 00:01:30.040
2020) annotated moral foundations in arguments and analyzed the correlation between morals and argument quality.

00:01:30.040 --> 00:01:34.607
We use their corpus in our experiments to evaluate our moral classifier.

00:01:34.607 --> 00:01:40.400
Argument Generation Argument generation approaches have been proposed for a spectrum of different tasks.

00:01:40.400 --> 00:01:41.905
Hua et al.

00:01:41.905 --> 00:01:44.922
2019) and Alshomary et al.

00:01:44.922 --> 00:01:54.815
2021b) worked on counter-argument generation, tackling the task by rebutting an argument's conclusion or by undermining one of its weak premises, respectively.

00:01:54.815 --> 00:02:51.182
Others opposed a given claim (Bilu et al., 2015;Hidey and McKeown, 2019), generated argumentative claims on a given topic controlled for certain aspects (Schiller et al., 2020) Care  14%  31%  19%  13%  16%  32%  20%  10%  Fairness  13%  26%  28%  22%  23%  9%  13%  16%  Loyalty  9%  13%  14%  21%  34%  20%  24%  38%  Authority  54%  25%  21%  7%  8%  2%  25%  8%  Purity  10%  5%  17%  36%  19%  37%  17%  28%   Table 1: Distribution of the five moral foundations across the eight topics in the constructed Reddit dataset.

The topics Cloning and School Uniforms are used for validation, all others for training.

00:02:56.537 --> 00:02:59.180
et Syed et al., 2021).

00:02:59.180 --> 00:03:05.235
However, none of these approaches considered generating augmentative texts that target a specific audience.

00:03:05.235 --> 00:03:07.915
Recently, Alshomary et al.

00:03:07.915 --> 00:03:16.845
2021a) introduced the task of belief-based claim generation, aiming to generate claims on a given topic that match a given target audience.

00:03:16.845 --> 00:03:21.200
As a model of beliefs, they considered people's stances on big issues.

00:03:21.200 --> 00:03:28.805
While they demonstrated the feasibility of encoding beliefs into claims, they did not study the effectiveness of these claims on an audience.

00:03:28.805 --> 00:03:34.185
Another driver in the field of argument generation is Project Debater by Slonim et al.

00:03:34.185 --> 00:03:35.777
2021).

00:03:35.777 --> 00:03:37.816
Project Debater is an end-to-end

00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.817
system for argument mining, retrieval, and generation.

00:00:03.817 --> 00:00:10.672
The system relies on a hybrid approach consisting of retrieval, mining, clustering, and rephrasing components.

00:00:10.672 --> 00:00:14.027
In their manual evaluation, Slonim et al.

00:00:14.027 --> 00:00:20.395
2021) observe a competent quality of generated arguments compared to those crafted by humans.

00:00:20.395 --> 00:00:24.350
To generate morally framed arguments, we extend their system.

00:00:24.350 --> 00:00:34.079
Relying on Project Debater helps us alleviate confounding effects of argument quality and, so, to focus on testing whether moral utilization affects the audience.

00:00:34.079 --> 00:00:36.872
Moral Foundation Classification

00:00:36.872 --> 00:00:42.302
Our proposed system relies on the ability to identify morals in arguments automatically.

00:00:42.302 --> 00:00:48.069
Existing approaches to mining morals from texts are either lexicon-based or machine learning-based.

00:00:48.069 --> 00:00:54.062
A number of datasets with morals have been constructed for domains such as social media or news articles.

00:00:54.062 --> 00:00:57.317
For argumentative texts, Kobbe et al.

00:00:57.317 --> 00:01:04.834
2020) manually annotated a small dataset of 220 arguments, which is only suitable for evaluation.

00:01:04.834 --> 00:01:14.827
We, therefore, decided to develop a moral foundation classifier based on data collected automatically using distant supervision, as explained in the following.

00:01:14.827 --> 00:01:16.557
Data Collection

00:01:16.557 --> 00:01:23.162
To circumvent the need for annotated data, we construct a training dataset following a distantsupervision approach.

00:01:23.162 --> 00:01:29.792
In particular, moral foundations are revealed as aspects of concerns in discussions of controversial topics.

00:01:29.792 --> 00:01:37.284
For example, when discussing School Uniform from the authority perspective, aspects such as respect and obedience often arise.

00:01:37.284 --> 00:01:41.777
Given this observation, we referred to the dataset of Schiller et al.

00:01:41.777 --> 00:01:49.582
2020) which contains short argumentative texts on eight topics along with aspects annotated automatically for each text.

00:01:49.582 --> 00:01:55.187
We then assigned each text a set of moral foundations based on the aspects appearing in the text.

00:01:55.187 --> 00:02:00.417
To map aspects to moral foundations, we employed the lexicon of Hulpus et al.

00:02:00.417 --> 00:02:05.097
2020) which connects moral foundations to Wikipedia concepts.

00:02:05.097 --> 00:02:16.152
After filtering out arguments without any mapping and balancing the data across the five moral foundations, this resulted in a dataset with 230k argumentative texts and the corresponding morals.

00:02:16.152 --> 00:02:22.744
We split the dataset into six topics for training and two for validation (testing will happen on other data below).

00:02:22.744 --> 00:02:27.412
Details on the distribution of the morals across topics are found in Table 1.

00:02:27.412 --> 00:02:37.242
To assess the quality of the distantly supervised dataset, two authors of the paper manually evaluated the correctness of the assigned morals on a sample of 100 examples.

00:02:37.242 --> 00:02:43.534
77% of the cases were considered correct by at least one author, 44% by both.

00:02:43.534 --> 00:02:53.177
The Cohen's  agreement was 0.32, which is not high, but in line with other subjective argumentrelated annotations (El Baff et al., 2018).

00:02:53.177 --> 00:02:57.807
Table 2 shows example sentences with assigned morals from the dataset.

00:02:57.807 --> 00:02:59.224
Approach

00:02:59.224 --> 00:03:08.479
We rely on a BERT-based classifier to identify morals in texts (Devlin et al., 2019), starting from the pre-trained bert-based-cased model.

00:03:08.479 --> 00:03:11.068
We finetuned the model on our training set for

00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.804
three epochs Argumentative Sentence

Abortion isn't murder because abortion is legal and murder is an illegal killing of another person.

Authority People that ignore the social contract and human decency aren't deterred by any punishment.

00:00:34.349 --> 00:00:38.142
with a batch size of 16 and a learning rate of 3  e 5 .

00:00:38.142 --> 00:00:44.222
In the training phase, the input was an argumentative sentence and the corresponding moral foundation.

00:00:44.222 --> 00:00:55.702
Since an argument may contain multiple sentences, each reflecting a specific moral, an argument's final set of morals consists of all sentences' morals predicted with confidence above 0.5.

00:00:55.702 --> 00:01:05.519
To assess the classifier's effectiveness more reliably, we trained six models on different random samples of size 50k and computed their average F 1 -score.

00:01:05.519 --> 00:01:06.862
Purity

00:01:06.862 --> 00:01:08.954
Experimental Setup

00:01:08.954 --> 00:01:12.247
For comparison, we consider two baselines.

00:01:12.247 --> 00:01:16.464
The first is the model performing best in the experiments of Kobbe et al.

00:01:16.464 --> 00:01:22.707
2020), which is a multi-label BERT-based model trained on the Twitter moral corpus of Hoover et al.

00:01:22.707 --> 00:01:24.024
2020).

00:01:24.024 --> 00:01:28.267
We trained our own version on the same dataset and referred to it as mBERT.

00:01:28.267 --> 00:01:39.022
The second baseline is a simple lexiconbased approach that computes the frequency of words belonging to each of the moral foundations (Araque et al., 2020), called Lexicon below.

00:01:39.022 --> 00:01:42.527
As a lexicon, we used the moralstrength library.

00:01:42.527 --> 00:01:43.482
3 .

00:01:43.482 --> 00:01:46.837
We tested all models on the dataset of Kobbe et al.

00:01:46.837 --> 00:01:53.629
2020), which consists of 220 arguments annotated for moral foundations by two annotators.

00:01:53.629 --> 00:02:00.197
Table 3 shows the F 1 -score of all evaluated models for each moral as well as the macro F 1 -score.

00:02:00.197 --> 00:02:04.064
Additionally, we show the precision and recall for each approach.

00:02:04.064 --> 00:02:11.644
In terms of F1-score, our approach outperforms both baselines across three of the five moral foundations as well as on average.

00:02:11.644 --> 00:02:31.724
We observe that effectiveness varies in terms of precision and recall between the Lexicon and the mBERT  Figure 1: High-level process of the proposed moral debater system, which extends the capabilities of Project Debater by moral tagging and filtering, in order to output a morally framed argument for a given topic, a stance on the topic, and a set of morals.

baseline.

00:02:34.572 --> 00:02:41.802
The stable effectiveness of our approach across the five morals signals the advantage of the proposed dataset that we used in our approach.

00:02:41.802 --> 00:02:47.032
Hence, we use this model later for morally framed argument generation in our system.

00:02:47.032 --> 00:02:54.887
Table 4 shows two example arguments with the manually annotated morals along with the ones predicted by the baselines and by our approach.

00:02:54.887 --> 00:03:02.817
We see that the Lexicon baseline assigns all morals to each argument most of the time, leading to the high recall across all morals.

00:03:02.817 --> 00:03:07.324
The first row of the table shows an example argument from the test set in which our a

00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.667
pproach was able to detect its authority moral while mBERT failed.

00:00:03.667 --> 00:00:12.859
In the second row, our approach missed the care moral in the argument but highlighted loyalty, a moral that probably emerges from the aspect of helping each other.

00:00:12.859 --> 00:00:15.102
The Moral Debater System

00:00:15.102 --> 00:00:21.207
This section describes the system that we developed to study the effect of morally framed arguments on the audience.

00:00:21.207 --> 00:00:28.999
Our design extends the capabilities available via the Project Debater API with the moral foundation classifier from Section 3.

00:00:28.999 --> 00:00:40.842
As input, it takes a controversial topic (say, "globalization"), a stance on the topic (say, pro), and a set of morals to be targeted (say, loyalty, authority, and purity).

00:00:40.842 --> 00:00:51.484
Then, it determines a collection of claims and evidence on the given topic that focus on the   Table 4: Ground-truth moral foundations of two example arguments from the dataset of Kobbe et al.

00:01:07.742 --> 00:01:13.859
We describe the three-step process in detail in the following, highlighting our proposed integration.

00:01:13.859 --> 00:01:16.914
Query Generation & Sentence Retrieval

00:01:16.914 --> 00:01:27.307
First, the system retrieves a collection of argumentative sentences discussing the controversial topic from Project Debater's index, which contains 400 million news articles.

00:01:27.307 --> 00:01:32.237
The articles are split into sentences and indexed along with several metaannotations.

00:01:32.237 --> 00:01:39.467
We generate several queries containing only the topic keywords without any topic expansion to focus on relevant sentences.

00:01:39.467 --> 00:01:45.472
We restrict the retrieved sentences to only those annotated as having sentiment or causality markers.

00:01:45.472 --> 00:01:49.464
Section 5 gives more details on the constructed queries.

00:01:49.464 --> 00:01:53.132
Moral Tagging and Filtering & Component Extraction

00:01:53.132 --> 00:02:00.037
Second, the trained classifier is used to annotate each argumentative sentence for all likely moral foundations.

00:02:00.037 --> 00:02:06.554
It then filters out those sentences that either does not have any moral or contain at least one moral not given as input.

00:02:06.554 --> 00:02:18.109
Next, through Project Debater's API, the system generates for each of the remaining sentences a likelihood score reflecting whether it contains a claim or evidence following the approach of Ein-Dor et al.

00:02:18.109 --> 00:02:19.427
2020).

00:02:19.427 --> 00:02:32.557
We instruct the API to keep only sentences having a claim with likelihood higher than claim_threshold or evidence with likelihood higher than evidence_threshold (the exact thresholds are given in Section 5).

00:02:32.557 --> 00:02:41.237
Additionally, the API identifies claim boundaries for sentences containing claims and extracts the exact span of text containing the claim.

00:02:41.237 --> 00:02:44.517
Input Aggregation & Narrative Generation

00:02:44.517 --> 00:02:51.434
Third, our proposed extension aggregates the given list of claims and evidence sentences with the input topic and stance.

00:02:51.434 --> 00:02:56.977
It then uses Project Debater's narrative generation API to generate the final argument.

00:02:56.977 --> 00:03:01.672
The narrative generation identifies the stance of claims and evidence towards the topic a

00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.817
ccording to the approach of Bar-Haim et al.

00:00:02.817 --> 00:00:04.397
2017).

00:00:04.397 --> 00:00:07.352
Only those matching the input stance are kept.

00:00:07.352 --> 00:00:17.145
Redundant elements are then filtered out, and the remaining ones are grouped into thematic clusters, where a theme is a Wikipedia title (Slonim et al., 2005).

00:00:17.145 --> 00:00:22.750
The process of building these clusters also includes extracting one claim that represents the theme.

00:00:22.750 --> 00:00:27.055
Each theme will then be represented by a paragraph in the output argument.

00:00:27.055 --> 00:00:42.347
Finally, a set of algorithms is used to perform various kinds of re-phrasing on the argument level (e.g., pronoun resolution) and on the paragraph level (e.g., ensuring that different arguments are put together) (Slonim et al., 2021).

00:00:42.347 --> 00:00:46.827
Example arguments with and without controlled morals are shown in Table 5.

00:00:46.827 --> 00:00:57.844
By concept, each argument starts with an introductory paragraph listing the main themes of discussion, followed by a set of paragraphs, each combining claims and evidence on one theme.

00:00:57.844 --> 00:01:00.387
Topic: Globalization

00:01:00.387 --> 00:01:04.992
Binding argument: The crowd raised four issues, explaining its views.

00:01:04.992 --> 00:01:09.809
The first claim is that globalization is reducing the importance of nation-states.

00:01:09.809 --> 00:01:14.952
The next issue will show how Globalization and structural forces aggravate poverty.

00:01:14.952 --> 00:01:18.382
In addition, we will hear about pollution and Culture.

00:01:18.382 --> 00:01:20.374
Lastly, Culture.

00:01:20.374 --> 00:01:31.017
Globalization has destabilized previously immutable social institutions, shifting cultural value away from old traditions to new more individualistic and market friendly ideas.

00:01:31.017 --> 00:01:35.197
It is often said to have a negative effect on the world's cultural diversity.

00:01:35.197 --> 00:01:48.714
Cultural and geographical dimensions of transformational leadership become blurred as globalization renders ethnically specific collectivist and individualistic effects of organizational behavior obsolete in a more diversified workplace.

00:01:48.714 --> 00:01:53.832
Individualizing argument: The crowd raised four issues, explaining its views.

00:01:53.832 --> 00:01:58.637
The first claim is that Globalization on its own cannot end gender inequality.

00:01:58.637 --> 00:02:02.842
In addition, we will hear about harm, economy and processes.

00:02:02.842 --> 00:02:05.122
Starting with gender inequality.

00:02:05.122 --> 00:02:10.927
There are various studies available that depict globalization as a hindrance toward gender inequality.

00:02:10.927 --> 00:02:14.744
Globalization on its own cannot end gender inequality.

00:02:14.744 --> 00:02:16.162
Turning to harm.

00:02:16.162 --> 00:02:24.179
Globalization is a threat to culture and religion, and it harms indigenous people groups while multinational corporations profit from it.

00:02:24.179 --> 00:02:32.484
It has been criticized for benefiting those who are already large and in power at the risk and growing vulnerability of the countries' indigenous population.

00:02:32.484 --> 00:02:37.402
Uncontrolled argument: The crowd raised four issues, explaining its views.

00:02:37.402 --> 00:02:43.444
The first claim is that globalisation creates economic and cultural imbalances in developing nations.

00:02:43.444 --> 00:02:48.649
The next issue will show how globalization is reducing the importance of nation-states.

00:02:48.649 --> 00:02:51.829
And the third point is that globalization is a threat.

00:02:51.829 --> 00:02:54.847
In addition, we will hear about processes.

00:02:54.847 --> 00:02:56.552
Starting with economy.

00:02:56.552 --> 00:03:03.472
Globalization does not work for all the economies that it affects, and that it does not always deliver the economic growth that i

00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:01.605
s expected of it.

00:00:01.605 --> 00:00:07.397
Globalisation and neoliberalism have exacerbated already unequal economic relations.

00:00:07.397 --> 00:00:19.690
Although globalization takes similar steps in most countries, scholars such as Hodge claim that it might not be effective to certain countries and that globalization has actually moved some countries backward instead of developing them.

00:00:19.690 --> 00:00:25.482
Table 5: Example generated arguments against Globalization for different focused morals.

00:00:29.225 --> 00:00:32.079
Full arguments are shown in the appendix.

00:00:32.079 --> 00:00:34.872
Studying the Effect of Moral Framing

00:00:34.872 --> 00:00:44.389
To evaluate our hypothesis on the effect of morally framed arguments, we carried out a user study with two opposing target audiences, liberals and conservatives.

00:00:44.389 --> 00:00:50.507
Our primary goal was to investigate whether morally framed arguments are more effective than uncontrolled ones.

00:00:50.507 --> 00:00:56.974
Additionally, we sought to determine whether differently-framed arguments affect liberals and conservatives differently.

00:00:56.974 --> 00:01:00.167
In the following, we report on this study.

00:01:00.167 --> 00:01:02.259
Experimental Setup

00:01:02.259 --> 00:01:08.439
Arguments We considered ten popular topics from the website debate.org, called big issues there.

00:01:08.439 --> 00:01:24.794
For each topic, we used our system to construct three arguments: one argument focusing on care and fairness (individualizing), one focusing on loyalty, authority, and purity (binding), and one baseline argument where we did not control the morals targeted (uncontrolled).

00:01:24.794 --> 00:01:32.874
We created arguments separately for both stances (pro and con), resulting in a total of 10  3  2 = 60 arguments.

00:01:32.874 --> 00:01:36.804
To construct each argument, we used the following parameters.

00:01:36.804 --> 00:01:43.597
For each topic, we built four queries, retrieving 10k sentences with 6 to 60 tokens per query.

00:01:43.597 --> 00:01:47.114
The first query retrieved sentences containing the topic.

00:01:47.114 --> 00:01:57.782
The second and third query targeted claim-like sentences, requiring the occurrence of (a) at least one causality marker or (b) both causality and a sentiment marker.

00:01:57.782 --> 00:02:01.887
Each needed to appear together with the topic in a window of 12 tokens.

00:02:01.887 --> 00:02:13.842
The last query aimed to retrieve evidence by filtering only those sentences that contained any of the following tokens: "surveys", "analyses", "researches", "reports", "research", and "survey".

00:02:13.842 --> 00:02:20.322
A moral was assigned to a retrieved sentence if the probability of our classifier was higher than 0.5.

00:02:20.322 --> 00:02:29.002
After initial tests, we set the claim_threshold and evidence_threshold to 0.8 and 0.6 respectively.

00:02:29.002 --> 00:02:33.894
We left all other settings to the default values of Project Debater's API.

00:02:33.894 --> 00:02:43.887
Internal Study on Argument Quality Before we launched our main study, two authors of this paper manually assessed the quality of the generated arguments and the morals addressed in each.

00:02:43.887 --> 00:02:52.254
In particular, each of them read all 60 arguments and ranked their relevance, coherence, and argumentativeness on a 5-point Likert scale.

00:02:52.254 --> 00:02:58.359
While reading each argument, they also highlighted spans of text that they found to reflect a specific moral.

00:02:58.359 --> 00:03:05.380
External Study on Argument Effectiveness To answer our research questions, we conducted a twophase user study on the platfo

00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:09.117
rm Upwork: First, we determined the political ideology of each participant, and then, we let selected participants rank the different arguments.

00:00:09.117 --> 00:00:22.235
In the first phase, we asked people living in the US that are experienced in writing and content editing to perform the Political Typology Quiz, available through the Pew Research Center, in order to   identify their political ideology.

00:00:22.235 --> 00:00:29.027
4 In 17 questions, the quiz asks participants to state their views on controversial issues in the US.

00:00:29.027 --> 00:00:36.870
The test results place the participants on a spectrum of ideologies from solid liberal (left) to core conservative (right).

00:00:36.870 --> 00:00:49.287
In the second phase, we chose only six participants from the first phase due to budget constraints, three solid liberals (one male, two female) and three core conservatives (two males, one female).

00:00:49.287 --> 00:00:57.742
We showed each of them three arguments (one individualizing, one binding, one uncontrolled) for all 20 topic-stance pairs.

00:00:57.742 --> 00:01:03.472
For each pair, the participants read the three arguments and ranked them by perceived effectiveness.

00:01:03.472 --> 00:01:05.677
We followed El Baff et al.

00:01:05.677 --> 00:01:15.970
2018), defining the effectiveness of an argument either by how empowering it is (if the participant has the same stance on the topic) or by how challenging it is (otherwise).

00:01:15.970 --> 00:01:27.712
For this purpose, the participants self-assessed their stances on each topic on a 5-point Likert scale, from 1 (strongly disagree) to 5 (strongly support) before reading the arguments.

00:01:27.712 --> 00:01:28.967
5

00:01:28.967 --> 00:01:30.484
Results

00:01:30.484 --> 00:01:36.502
In the following, we present the results of both studies, attempting to answer our research questions.

00:01:36.502 --> 00:01:43.269
Table 6 presents the quality scores for each argument type and Table 7 the distribution of moral foundations.

00:01:43.269 --> 00:01:52.974
Comparing the scores of binding and individualizing arguments to the uncontrolled ones, we see that our method did not notably worsen the quality of the generated arguments.

00:01:52.974 --> 00:02:04.792
The moral foundation distribution   indicates that binding arguments have a relatively higher focus on loyalty, authority, and purity than the individualizing arguments and a lower focus on fairness and care.

00:02:04.792 --> 00:02:09.284
This supports the impact of our method on controlling morals in arguments.

00:02:09.284 --> 00:02:11.139
Argument Quality

00:02:11.139 --> 00:02:13.632
Empowering vs. Challenging Figure ?

00:02:13.632 --> 00:02:17.362
shows the distribution of challenging and empowering arguments.

00:02:17.362 --> 00:02:29.904
Liberals were more decisive with their stance on the given topics, with 73% being on the pro side, whereas only 30% of the conservatives were on that side (50% con side, 20% no stance).

00:02:29.904 --> 00:02:37.947
Since we presented arguments for both sides for each topic, we had an equal distribution of empowering and challenging arguments for the liberals.

00:02:37.947 --> 00:02:46.114
However, for conservatives, we had 40% empowering and 40% challenging arguments due to the 20% undecided cases.

00:02:46.114 --> 00:02:56.444
Since arguments supporting one side of a debate are rather challenging for the undecided audience, in our analysis below, we consider the 20% undecided cases to be challenging.

00:02:56.444 --> 00:03:05.308
Table 8 shows the rank distribution for morally-framed arguments (binding and individualizing) compared to the uncontrolled ones for liberals, conservative

00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:01.755
s, and all together.

00:00:01.755 --> 00:00:14.772
In general, the participants ranked the arguments framed in terms of fairness and care (individualizing) significantly better than the uncontrolled ones, with an average rank of 1.72 compared to 2.08.

00:00:14.772 --> 00:00:20.815
6 This difference is significant at p < 0.05 using student t-test.

00:00:20.815 --> 00:00:27.682
This signals a positive answer to our first research question: a focus on morals can make arguments more effective.

00:00:27.682 --> 00:00:40.162
A closer look at the distribution of arguments at Rank 1 shows that conservatives were more susceptible to moral arguments (75% binding and individualizing) compared to liberals (63%).

00:00:40.162 --> 00:00:49.829
Next, we examine whether arguments with different morals affect liberals and conservatives differently by looking at the achieved ranks of both empowering and challenging arguments.

00:00:49.829 --> 00:00:52.459
Effectiveness of Moral Arguments

00:00:52.459 --> 00:01:04.752
Effectiveness depending on Ideology Looking at the mean ranks assigned by liberals in Table 9, we observe that challenging arguments that focus on individualizing morals (care and fairness) are most effective.

00:01:04.752 --> 00:01:10.607
We validate that the difference is significant for p < 0.1 using student t-test.

00:01:10.607 --> 00:01:18.724
This is in line with Feinberg and Willer (2015) who found that arguments framed in terms of liberal morals were more convincing to liberals.

00:01:18.724 --> 00:01:23.404
Notably, this effectiveness slightly decreases when arguments are empowering.

00:01:23.404 --> 00:01:33.822
A reasonable hypothesis is that, in the 6 The difference in mean ranks is 0.36, 95% CI [0.17, 0.57].

00:01:33.822 --> 00:01:41.677
case of empowering arguments, the audience may be more interested in the opposing views, which might be covered by uncontrolled arguments.

00:01:41.677 --> 00:01:46.319
We investigate this hypothesis further via a follow-up questionnaire below.

00:01:46.319 --> 00:01:48.749
Now, we look at the conservatives.

00:01:48.749 --> 00:02:02.804
Although they also valued the individual arguments the most, we observe that, when arguments challenged their views, a focus on binding morals (loyalty, authority, and purity) became slightly more effective than the uncontrolled arguments.

00:02:02.804 --> 00:02:13.347
Generally, morally framed arguments that challenged the views of conservatives were significantly more effective than uncontrolled ones at p < 0.1 using the student t-test.

00:02:13.347 --> 00:02:16.014
Agreement across Ideologies

00:02:16.014 --> 00:02:23.482
We measured inter-annotator agreement between the participants using Kendall's W ( Kendall and Smith, 1939).

00:02:23.482 --> 00:02:27.499
The agreement of all six participants was 0.29.

00:02:27.499 --> 00:02:36.954
In contrast, when considering liberals and conservatives separately, it increased to 0.35 for liberals and 0.51 for conservatives.

00:02:36.954 --> 00:02:46.809
This indicates higher agreement between participants having similar political ideology and matches the common notion that conservatives are more unified in their views than liberals.

00:02:46.809 --> 00:02:49.727
Reasons behind Effectiveness Judgments

00:02:49.727 --> 00:02:54.332
In a follow-up questionnaire, we investigated our participants' judgments.

00:02:54.332 --> 00:03:10.744
We asked them to self-assess whether they prefer (1) arguments with knowledge they have or are not familiar with, (2) arguments that matched or challenged their own views, (3) arguments that convince others who share or oppose their views, and (4) what affected the judgments of argument effectiveness

00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.492
more: knowledge or views, each in empowering and challenging cases.

00:00:04.492 --> 00:00:09.985
Table 10 shows that the participants ranked knowledge as the most relevant effectiveness aspect.

00:00:09.985 --> 00:00:19.602
In terms of others' views, the majority valued arguments that focus on the opposing views, whereas preferences differ for empowering and challenging arguments on own views.

00:00:19.602 --> 00:00:28.620
Due to the reliability issues of self-assessment of one's moral judgments (Pizarro, 2000), we acknowledge the limitation of this study, though.

00:00:28.620 --> 00:00:33.037
We present details on the questionnaire and its results in the appendix.

00:00:33.037 --> 00:00:35.479
Discussion and Limitations

00:00:35.479 --> 00:00:44.534
We explicitly acknowledge the limited number of liberals and conservatives that we recruited in our final user study, who might not represent the whole  population.

00:00:44.534 --> 00:00:53.264
Since the low sample size affects the reliability of our results, we performed significance tests to report our main results with a certain confidence level.

00:00:53.264 --> 00:01:00.619
As far as budget permits, further studies should be run with a more significant sample to reassess the reliability of the results.

00:01:00.619 --> 00:01:11.474
Despite the limitation above, the results of our evaluation indicate that arguments targeting the moral foundations of care and fairness are more effective than others, at least in the tested sample.

00:01:11.474 --> 00:01:17.517
Also, we observed that focusing on the audience's views in challenging arguments makes them more effective.

00:01:17.517 --> 00:01:32.534
Regarding political ideologies, while our results match the literature in that liberals were affected more by arguments focusing on their views (care and fairness), especially when challenged, conservatives did not rank binding arguments higher than individualizing ones.

00:01:32.534 --> 00:01:39.014
However, the conservatives still showed a higher tendency to be affected by morally framed arguments than liberals.

00:01:39.014 --> 00:01:46.157
Our approach is limited by its capability to retrieve argumentative texts that discuss the topic from different moral perspectives.

00:01:46.157 --> 00:01:52.274
In the retrieval component, we have focused on obtaining sentences containing precisely the addressed topic.

00:01:52.274 --> 00:01:57.479
A more elaborated approach could broaden the search to relevant topics through topic expansion.

00:01:57.479 --> 00:02:05.584
Further, we could use Project Debater only through the predefined API, restricting the way we integrate the moral tagging of sentences.

00:02:05.584 --> 00:02:12.814
Ideally, it would be performed during indexing; then, choosing the morals to focus on could be defined as part of the queries.

00:02:12.814 --> 00:02:20.519
Also, it is noteworthy that our moral classifier is trained on an automatically annotated dataset which may have limited its performance.

00:02:20.519 --> 00:02:28.874
Still, we demonstrated that it is feasible to tune arguments automatically to target certain morals and that such arguments tend to be more effective.

00:02:28.874 --> 00:02:34.979
Moreover, our results indicate that differently framed arguments have a different effect on different audiences.

00:02:34.979 --> 00:02:44.834
This opens opportunities for generating more effective arguments when targeting a specific audience, bridging the gap between disagreeing parties by focusing on the shared beliefs.

00:02:44.834 --> 00:02:46.439
Conclusion

00:02:46.439 --> 00:02:50.332
In this work, we have proposed an extension of Project Debater that ge

00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.442
nerates morally framed arguments.

00:00:02.442 --> 00:00:12.822
Due to the lack of training data for classifying morals, we have used distant supervision to collect a large set of argumentative sentences automatically annotated for moral foundations.

00:00:12.822 --> 00:00:17.440
Training a BERT-based classifier on the data yielded stateof-the-art results.

00:00:17.440 --> 00:00:24.482
We have integrated the classifier with functionalities of Project Debater to tune arguments tuned towards specific morals.

00:00:24.482 --> 00:00:31.962
According to our user study, arguments with morals relevant to liberals are more effective than arguments without any control of morals.

00:00:31.962 --> 00:00:35.730
Also, conservatives were more affected by moral arguments.

00:00:35.730 --> 00:00:40.485
Our results demonstrate the feasibility of generating morally framed arguments.

00:00:40.485 --> 00:00:48.214
By focusing on shared morals, we believe that a respective system helps bridge disagreement of opposing audiences in practice.

00:00:48.214 --> 00:00:49.944
Acknowledgments

00:00:49.944 --> 00:01:03.337
This work was funded by the Deutsche Forschungsgemeinschaft (DFG, German Research Foundation): TRR 318/1 2021 -438445824.

00:01:03.337 --> 00:01:09.217
We would also like to thank the reviewers and the participants who took part anonymously in our user study.

00:01:09.217 --> 00:01:11.034
Ethical Statement

00:01:11.034 --> 00:01:16.577
The responsible administrative board of Paderborn University formally approved our external study.

00:01:16.577 --> 00:01:23.069
We did not gather any personal information about the participants that could connect their ideologies to their identity.

00:01:23.069 --> 00:01:28.274
Accordingly, no sensitive information was sent via the Project Debater API.

00:01:28.274 --> 00:01:36.817
Also, we ensured that they get paid more than the minimum wage in the U.S., namely 75$ for a workload of 3 to 3.5 hours.

00:01:36.817 --> 00:01:44.834
Once more, we would like to indicate here that the results of this paper should be considered preliminary due to the limited number of surveyed users.

00:01:44.834 --> 00:01:48.327
Budget constraints did not allow to increase this number.

00:01:48.327 --> 00:01:53.307
Working on technologies that aim to persuade an audience raises ethical concerns.

00:01:53.307 --> 00:02:00.099
Using knowledge about a user's morals is a critical act, and if done, it should be clearly communicated to the users.

00:02:00.099 --> 00:02:06.242
Similarly, generating arguments aiming to convince the audience could be thought of as a manipulation attempt.

00:02:06.242 --> 00:02:15.672
To avoid manipulation, any technology aiming at convincing the audience should be transparent about it by keeping the user informed of how their information is being used.

00:02:15.672 --> 00:02:28.152
Since we rely on the arguments provided by the Project Debater API, we ultimately cannot control their content, but our internal quality assessment study did not raise any notable concerns on the information contained.

00:02:28.152 --> 00:02:35.607
As mentioned, the long-term goal of our envisioned system is not to use the audience's morals to generate arguments that convince them.

00:02:35.607 --> 00:02:43.712
Rather, given two disagreeing parties, the goal is to generate a wider spectrum of arguments covering relevant morals for both parties.

00:02:43.712 --> 00:02:50.892
We have argued in this paper that such morally rich arguments are more effective and could better achieve agreement between the disagreeing parties.

00:02:50.892 --> 00:02:55.622
Similarly, we ask the same questions in the case of empowering arguments.

00:02:55.622 --> 00:03:00.700
Table 9 summarizes the results of the four asked questions in both empowering and ch

00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:01.680
allenging arguments.

00:00:01.680 --> 00:00:09.535
In general, among the three aspects, the knowledge aspect was the most relevant one to the majority of the annotators (last row).

00:00:09.535 --> 00:00:21.077
When the annotators were asked about the their own views (first row), conservatives favored mostly arguments that challenged their own views, while liberals favored mostly empowering arguments that matched their views.

00:00:21.077 --> 00:00:29.195
Regarding others' views, most conservatives and liberals valued empowering arguments that were particularly convincing to people that oppose their views.

00:00:29.195 --> 00:00:40.124
Nevertheless, we acknowledge the limited reliability of such self-assessment of one's moral judgments due to the complicated cognitive mechanisms behind it (Pizarro, 2000).

00:00:40.124 --> 00:00:42.804
B Example Generated Arguments

00:00:42.804 --> 00:00:52.034
We present in Table 7-9 a sample of generated arguments on three topics focusing on both individualizing and binding morals, as well as uncontrolled.

00:00:52.034 --> 00:01:03.089
Table 11: Distribution of preferences (options) selected by the liberal and conservative annotators for each of the four asked questions for both the empowering and challenging cases.

00:01:03.089 --> 00:01:05.632
Topic: Globalization

00:01:05.632 --> 00:01:10.237
Binding argument: The crowd raised four issues, explaining its views.

00:01:10.237 --> 00:01:15.054
The first claim is that globalization is reducing the importance of nation-states.

00:01:15.054 --> 00:01:20.197
The next issue will show how Globalization and structural forces aggravate poverty.

00:01:20.197 --> 00:01:23.627
In addition, we will hear about pollution and Culture.

00:01:23.627 --> 00:01:25.669
Starting with nation states.

00:01:25.669 --> 00:01:29.537
Globalization is reducing the importance of nation-states.

00:01:29.537 --> 00:01:37.017
It has fueled the rise of transnational corporations, and their power has vaulted to the point where they can now rival many nation states.

00:01:37.017 --> 00:01:44.322
This trend may threaten national identity because globalization undermines the importance of being a citizen of a particular country.

00:01:44.322 --> 00:01:50.677
According to Ramonet, globalization and ultra-liberalism threaten the sovereignty of national states.

00:01:50.677 --> 00:02:03.319
Some scholars have argued that increasing globalization has actually led to a contemporary form of imperialism, in which economic and cultural norms and discourses are imposed by dominant nations on weaker nations.

00:02:03.319 --> 00:02:04.887
Turning to poverty.

00:02:04.887 --> 00:02:09.254
Critics of globalization say that it disadvantages poorer countries.

00:02:09.254 --> 00:02:16.047
Globalization and structural forces aggravate poverty and continue to push individuals to the margins of society.

00:02:16.047 --> 00:02:35.539
Academic contributors to The Routledge Handbook of Poverty in the United States postulate that new and extreme forms of poverty have emerged in the U.S. as a result of neoliberal structural adjustment policies and globalization, which have rendered economically marginalized communities as destitute "surplus populations" in need of control and punishment.

00:02:35.539 --> 00:02:37.682
Pollution was also mentioned.

00:02:37.682 --> 00:02:46.387
Globalization creates risks that concern people from all different classes; for example, radioactivity, pollution, and even unemployment.

00:02:46.387 --> 00:02:53.504
As International commerce develops new trade routes, markets and products it facilitates the spread of invasive species.

00:02:53.504 --> 00:02:55.497
Lastly, Culture.

00:02:55.497 --> 00:03:00.448
Globalization has destabilized previously immutable social institutions, shi

00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:06.080
fting cultural value away from old traditions to new more individualistic and market friendly ideas.

00:00:06.080 --> 00:00:10.260
It is often said to have a negative effect on the world's cultural diversity.

00:00:10.260 --> 00:00:23.777
Cultural and geographical dimensions of transformational leadership become blurred as globalization renders ethnically specific collectivist and individualistic effects of organizational behavior obsolete in a more diversified workplace.

00:00:23.777 --> 00:00:28.895
Individualizing argument: The crowd raised four issues, explaining its views.

00:00:28.895 --> 00:00:33.700
The first claim is that Globalization on its own cannot end gender inequality.

00:00:33.700 --> 00:00:37.905
In addition, we will hear about harm, economy and processes.

00:00:37.905 --> 00:00:40.185
Starting with gender inequality.

00:00:40.185 --> 00:00:45.990
There are various studies available that depict globalization as a hindrance toward gender inequality.

00:00:45.990 --> 00:00:49.807
Globalization on its own cannot end gender inequality.

00:00:49.807 --> 00:00:51.225
Turning to harm.

00:00:51.225 --> 00:00:55.830
Some critics of globalization argue that it harms the diversity of cultures.

00:00:55.830 --> 00:01:03.847
Globalization is a threat to culture and religion, and it harms indigenous people groups while multinational corporations profit from it.

00:01:03.847 --> 00:01:12.152
It has been criticized for benefiting those who are already large and in power at the risk and growing vulnerability of the countries' indigenous population.

00:01:12.152 --> 00:01:20.945
As of recently, it has been argued that globalization poses a threat to the CHS way of thinking because it often leads to the dissolution of distinct states.

00:01:20.945 --> 00:01:23.062
Economy was also mentioned.

00:01:23.062 --> 00:01:36.342
According to many left-wing greens, economic globalization is considered a threat to wellbeing, which will replace natural environments and local cultures with a single trade economy, termed the global economic monoculture.

00:01:36.342 --> 00:01:42.110
Globalisation is the cause of slow growth, unemployment and excessive debt in Western economies.

00:01:42.110 --> 00:01:46.565
It makes people poor by taking away money from people who formerly had it.

00:01:46.565 --> 00:01:54.507
Globalization does not work for all the economies that it affects, and that it does not always deliver the economic growth that is expected of it.

00:01:54.507 --> 00:02:02.925
It is pretty much making all poor countries richer with the exception of various african countries because of their continious state of war between the local tribes.

00:02:02.925 --> 00:02:04.905
Lastly, processes.

00:02:04.905 --> 00:02:14.760
Processes of globalization present humankind with many issues that are considered problematic in at least one culture or society, and often multiple societies.

00:02:14.760 --> 00:02:26.052
The books suggest that contemporary processes of globalization and mediatization have contributed to materially abstracting relations between people, with major consequences for how we live our lives.

00:02:26.052 --> 00:02:31.532
On the other side, the process of globalization has generated universal disenchantment.

00:02:31.532 --> 00:02:36.450
Uncontrolled argument: The crowd raised four issues, explaining its views.

00:02:36.450 --> 00:02:42.492
The first claim is that globalisation creates economic and cultural imbalances in developing nations.

00:02:42.492 --> 00:02:47.697
The next issue will show how globalization is reducing the importance of nation-states.

00:02:47.697 --> 00:02:50.877
And the third point is that globalization is a threat.

00:02:50.877 --> 00:02:53.895
In addition, we will hear about processes.

00:02:53.895 --> 00:02:55.600
Starting with economy.

00:02:55.600 --> 00:02:57.676
Globalization does not work for all

00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:06.005
the economies that it affects, and that it does not always deliver the economic growth that is expected of it.

00:00:06.005 --> 00:00:11.797
Globalisation and neoliberalism have exacerbated already unequal economic relations.

00:00:11.797 --> 00:00:24.090
Although globalization takes similar steps in most countries, scholars such as Hodge claim that it might not be effective to certain countries and that globalization has actually moved some countries backward instead of developing them.

00:00:24.090 --> 00:00:26.020
Turning to nation states.

00:00:26.020 --> 00:00:29.887
Globalization is reducing the importance of nation-states.

00:00:29.887 --> 00:00:35.617
It engenders conflicts within and between nations over domestic norms and social institutions.

00:00:35.617 --> 00:00:42.922
This trend may threaten national identity because globalization undermines the importance of being a citizen of a particular country.

00:00:42.922 --> 00:00:49.277
According to Ramonet, globalization and ultra-liberalism threaten the sovereignty of national states.

00:00:49.277 --> 00:00:51.170
Threats was also mentioned.

00:00:51.170 --> 00:01:03.125
Case studies of Thailand and the Arab nations' view of globalization show that globalization is a threat to culture and religion, and it harms indigenous people groups while multinational corporations profit from it.

00:01:03.125 --> 00:01:11.917
As of recently, it has been argued that globalization poses a threat to the CHS way of thinking because it often leads to the dissolution of distinct states.

00:01:11.917 --> 00:01:13.897
Lastly, processes.

00:01:13.897 --> 00:01:26.815
The combined processes of industrialization and globalization have disrupted longstanding livelihoods and systems of production, forcing many families to focus more on income-generating activities than on subsistence practices.

00:01:26.815 --> 00:01:46.307
Academic contributors to The Routledge Handbook of Poverty in the United States postulate that new and extreme forms of poverty have emerged in the U.S. as a result of neoliberal structural adjustment policies and globalization, which have rendered economically marginalized communities as destitute "surplus populations" in need of control and punishment.

00:01:46.307 --> 00:01:53.350
It was in essence an affirmative action scheme to assist geographically disadvantaged students to gain tertiary education.

00:01:53.350 --> 00:02:02.517
The obvious solution to all the Affirmative Action controversy is to offer full financial assistance to all university students with need, regardless of race.

00:02:02.517 --> 00:02:04.310
Moving on to policy.

00:02:04.310 --> 00:02:14.365
This executive order created a National Women's Business Enterprise Policy and required government agencies to take affirmative action in support of women's business enterprises.

00:02:14.365 --> 00:02:23.907
Following the riots, the Malaysian Government introduced affirmative action policies to help the Bumiputera to achieve a higher economic quality of life than the Chinese.

00:02:23.907 --> 00:02:30.312
Ethiopian government policy has supported affirmative action for women since its inception in 1994.

00:02:30.312 --> 00:02:40.430
The ACLU's official position statements, as of January 2012, included the following policies: Affirmative action -The ACLU supports affirmative action.

00:02:40.430 --> 00:02:42.685
The last issue mentioned was women.

00:02:42.685 --> 00:02:45.827
Hunter is a supporter of affirmative action for women.

00:02:45.827 --> 00:02:51.682
He is highly in favor of affirmative action and supports setting aside funds for women and minorities.

00:02:51.682 --> 00:02:54.580
According to a poll taken by USA Today in 20

00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:07.005
05, the majority of Americans support affirmative action for women, while views on minority groups were more split.

00:00:07.005 --> 00:00:09.522
It support affirmative action for women.

00:00:09.522 --> 00:00:22.377
Affirmative Action and Impact Sourcing Tata BSS is an avid supporter of Affirmative Action and hence employs huge number of SC/ST community people in their operations thereby making a huge impact on the society.

00:00:22.377 --> 00:00:30.107
Individualizing argument: Employment, discrimination, universities and policy are the four issues the crowd elaborated on.

00:00:30.107 --> 00:00:32.625
Let's explore the issue of employment.

00:00:32.625 --> 00:00:38.705
Affirmative action legislation has led to substantial improvements in the employment of minorities and women.

00:00:38.705 --> 00:00:47.310
They also require Federal contractors and subcontractors to take affirmative action to ensure equal employment opportunity in their employment processes.

00:00:47.310 --> 00:01:02.340
Historically and internationally, support for affirmative action has sought to achieve goals such as bridging inequalities in employment and pay, increasing access to education, promoting diversity, and redressing apparent past wrongs, harms, or hindrance.

00:01:02.340 --> 00:01:04.732
The next issue is discrimination.

00:01:04.732 --> 00:01:09.775
The affirmative action program is designed to remedy the effects of past discrimination.

00:01:09.775 --> 00:01:25.817
In 2004, he reiterated his support, "I support affirmative action programs, including in appropriate instances consideration of race and gender in government contracting decisions, when the affirmative action program is designed to remedy the effects of past discrimination.". 

00:01:25.817 --> 00:01:32.760
Alongside the prohibition against unfair discrimination, affirmative action is the second cornerstone of the EEA.

00:01:32.760 --> 00:01:36.790
A common approach to remedying discrimination is affirmative action.

00:01:36.790 --> 00:01:38.832
Moving on to universities.

00:01:38.832 --> 00:01:42.720
The National Conference of State Legislatures held in Washington D.C.

00:01:42.720 --> 00:01:55.387
stated in a 2014 overview that many supporters for affirmative action argue that policies stemming from affirmative action help to open doors for historically excluded groups in workplace settings and higher education.

00:01:55.387 --> 00:02:01.130
Race-based affirmative action was necessary to achieve diversity and its educational benefits.

00:02:01.130 --> 00:02:07.285
Affirmative action provides some disadvantaged youth with increased chances of attending top-tier university.

00:02:07.285 --> 00:02:10.577
Action is thus more important than abstract knowledge.

00:02:10.577 --> 00:02:13.120
The last issue mentioned was policy.

00:02:13.120 --> 00:02:25.550
According to its website, the NCP is committed to ideals of social justice, expressing support for affirmative action policies for the downtrodden members of society and for ensuring equal opportunities for all.

00:02:25.550 --> 00:02:31.780
Such legislation and affirmative action policies have been critical to bringing changes in societal attitudes.

00:02:31.780 --> 00:02:39.035
The school applies an affirmative action policy to ensure marginalized students from hardship semi-arid areas are given a chance.

00:02:39.035 --> 00:02:45.015
Affirmative Action Policy is to ensure the peace and stability in the pluralist society of Malaysia.

00:02:45.015 --> 00:02:47.732
It was found to address Malay grievances.

00:02:47.732 --> 00:02:55.262
Uncontrolled argument: Discrimination, effectiveness, the supreme court and women are the four issues the crowd elaborated on.

00:02:55.262 --> 00:02:56.920
Let's explore the issue of di

00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:01.480
scrimination.

00:00:01.480 --> 00:00:12.210
1961: Executive Order 10925: Required government contractors to "take affirmative action" to ensure non-discriminatory employment practices.

00:00:12.210 --> 00:00:19.627
It supports affirmative action as necessary in the fight for equality and it opposes all forms of racism and religious bigotry.

00:00:19.627 --> 00:00:28.907
Right to affirmative action All federal employers or federal contractors are required to take affirmative action to help counteract the effects of historical discrimination.

00:00:28.907 --> 00:00:42.987
CAMERA argues the Law of Return is justified under the Convention on the Elimination of All Forms of Racial Discrimination Article I, which CAMERA argues allows for affirmative action, because of the discrimination Jews faced during the Holocaust.

00:00:42.987 --> 00:00:45.155
The next issue is effectiveness.

00:00:45.155 --> 00:00:48.197
In philosophy, Action is effective will.

00:00:48.197 --> 00:00:54.865
Collective action is the most effective means of preventing potential state and non-state aggressors from threatening other states.

00:00:54.865 --> 00:00:57.882
Such action is effective in spreading our message.

00:00:57.882 --> 00:01:00.025
Moving on to the supreme court.

00:01:00.025 --> 00:01:01.167
Utter v.

00:01:01.167 --> 00:01:07.272
Bollinger: The Supreme Court of the United States upholds affirmative action in university admissions.

00:01:07.272 --> 00:01:14.565
The court found that the University of Michigan's Law School's affirmative action admission policies were promoting diversity within its school.

00:01:14.565 --> 00:01:25.257
Importantly, though, it ruled that a university was entitled to "no deference" on its judgment that race-based affirmative action was necessary to achieve diversity and its educational benefits.

00:01:25.257 --> 00:01:30.162
Another controversial decision of the Rehnquist court in 2003 was Grutter v.

00:01:30.162 --> 00:01:32.830
Bollinger which upheld affirmative action.

00:01:32.830 --> 00:01:47.760
A prominent advocate of affirmative action, he played a leading role in the twin Supreme Court cases-Grutter v Bollinger and Gratz v Bollinger-that upheld and clarified the importance of diversity as a compelling justification for affirmative action in higher education.

00:01:47.760 --> 00:01:50.015
The last issue mentioned was women.

00:01:50.015 --> 00:01:54.895
Affirmative action programs to women in an effort to end gender discrimination.

00:01:54.895 --> 00:02:01.662
Genderaffirmative practices recognize and support an individual's unique gender self-identification and expression.

00:02:01.662 --> 00:02:11.905
Wesolowski supported affirmative action programs for Saskatoon Catholic teachers in 2001, arguing that past policies had discriminated against women and aboriginals.

00:02:11.905 --> 00:02:21.497
For women business owners, affirmative action programs are considered legislation that encourage government agencies and contractors to do business with women-owned businesses.

00:02:21.497 --> 00:02:23.090
Turning to government.

00:02:23.090 --> 00:02:30.545
Prostitution should be decriminalized, and as a libertarian insists the sex trade should not be regulated by the government.

00:02:30.545 --> 00:02:38.637
According to data from the Office for National Statistics, it contributed 5.3 billion to the UK economy in 2009.

00:02:38.637 --> 00:02:50.092
This, the sex work perspective asserts, will allow prostitution to be regulated by governments and business codes, protect sex trade workers, and improve the ability to prosecute people who hurt them.
